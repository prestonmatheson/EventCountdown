# React with Bootstrap Starter Project

> Provided for the students of the [Bottega Code School](https://bottega.tech/)

*Fork from [es6-webpack2-starter](https://github.com/micooz/es6-webpack2-starter)*

* I'll be using this as a base while I am learning. This will be my solo attempt to do a react countdown app based off of a date given

# TODO's  

* Updating the date adds another loop on the display and it rotates between flashing everything in the loop

* Add a clear button for the event countdown
